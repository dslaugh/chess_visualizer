# Chess Visualizer

This is a chess game that highlights all attacked/defended pieces.

It has the ability to go back and forward through the history and you can turn highlighting on and off.

You can see it in action [here](https://quizzical-fermi-8ff771.netlify.com/)

It was bootstrapped with create-react-app so you can clone the repo and type
```npm install``` and then ```npm start``` to run it.
